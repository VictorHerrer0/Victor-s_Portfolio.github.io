									<hr>	
									<p>
										For those who want to know me, My name is Victor Herrero and I am a young professional, who has always been interested in the world of Data. From Data Analysis to Database management, it's simply something I enjoy.																										
										<p>Most of what you'll find here is stuff I learned on my own, practising with demo databases and data I found online. Apart from a few courses, I have only had one real experience on data projects, and that was during my first internship, where I had to build a couple of simple Dashboards and perform various Analyses using Excel.																											
										<p>It was right after that, where I decided to start working on my hard skills with the objective of applying to an Analytical role (related to data) at basically any company. Fortunately, that did not happen :D.										
										<p>Instead, I started working in the SaaS industry as a Solution Consultant, where I learned how to deal with clients and follow a project timeline but most importantly, where I understood the need of developing a more critical thinking. It also gave me a broader understanding of how Data needs to be processed and the impact that this currently has on decision making at a management level.																												
										<p>This brings us to today, you... here, me... with some more Data expertise and a clear chance for you
										<h3>To give me my first opportunity...</p>
